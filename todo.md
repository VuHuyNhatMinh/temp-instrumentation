- [x] Architecture Design
- [x] Select temperature sensor: LM35
- [x] Select components for MCU MCS 51: AT89S52
- [x] How to upload code to MCU MCS 51
- [x] Try project in breadboard
- [x] Make PCB
- [ ] calculate average datas taken in for accuracy	(now we only present realtime data sent back from sensor)
- [x] sampling every ten secs, user timer (now we're preseting data to 7seg every time sensor sends sample) 
- [ x break out of warning loop using interupt, only push (now we are using holding-button to break out)
- [ ] How to read a single bit from 8051 port
- [ ] Create PCB v2
- [ ] Optimize Software v2
- [ ] Write README.md
