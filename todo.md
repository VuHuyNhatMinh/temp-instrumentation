- [X] How to upload code to MCU MCS 51
- [ ] Try project in breadboard
- [ ] Make PCB
- [ ] calculate average datas taken in for accuracy	(now we only present realtime data sent back from sensor)
- [ ] sampling every ten secs, user timer (now we're preseting data to 7seg every time sensor sends sample) 
- [ ] break out of warning loop using interupt, only push (now we are using holding-button to break out)
